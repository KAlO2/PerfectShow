# PerfectShow

Welcome to PerfectShow, an image processing application for Android platform.

Up until now, I release functionality about make-up.

This project mainly use [stasm](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/) for face detecting, [dlib](http://dlib.net/) can be more superior and robust, and it use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for color blending and image processing, so you might as well have a good grasp of this field.

# Usage
download [OpenCV 4](https://opencv.org/releases/) and extract it somewhere. There is no need to be in this project, then link the OpenCV directory to this project in the file gradle.property, search opencv_sdk variable and replace it with your own.
